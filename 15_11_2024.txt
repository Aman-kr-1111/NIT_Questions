Question -1
--------------
volume of a cube, cylinder, and sphere.

Implement methods to calculate the volume of a cube, cylinder, and sphere. Overload these methods to handle different combinations of parameters like radius, height, and side length.

 Parent class Shape

 Method to calculate volume of a cube

Method Name calculateVolume parameter (double sideLength)

Access Modifier:-

public 

Return type:-

double


Take another class Cylinder

 Method to calculate volume of a cylinder

Method Name calculateVolume parameter (double radius,double height)

Access Modifier:-

public 

Return type:-

double


Method to calculate volume of a sphere

Method Name calculateVolume parameter (double radius)

Access Modifier:-

public 

Return type:-

double



 Subclass Cube inheriting from Shape

 Method overriding to provide specific implementation for cubes

 Reusing the parent class method for cubes



   Subclass Cylinder inheriting from Shape

 Method overriding to provide specific implementation for cylinders

 Reusing the parent class method for cylinders


 Subclass Sphere inheriting from Shape

 Method overriding to provide specific implementation for spheres
 Reusing the parent class method for spheres

 Create a class MainShape which contains main method to test your code.
 Creating objects of different shapes, Calculating volumes using different methods based on shape
 Call the methods.


Formula:-

Cube:- n*n*n

Cylender:- pi*r*r*h

Sphere:-4/3*pi*r*r



Volume of the Cube: 27.0

Volume of the Cylinder: 25.132741228718345

Volume of the Sphere: 14.137166941154069



Test Case 1: 
---------------
Negative Side Length for Cube

Input:
Cube side length: -3.0

Expected Output:
"Error: Side length cannot be negative."

Test Case 2: Valid Input for Cube
Input:
Cube side length: 3.0
Expected Output:
Volume of the Cube: 27.0

Test Case 3: Valid Input for Cylinder
Input:
Cylinder radius: 2.0, height: 2.0
Expected Output:
Volume of the Cylinder: 25.132741228718345



Question-2
--------------

Create a superclass called Animal

Impliment a method  makeSound() that prints a generic sound. 

Method Name: makeSound
Access Modifier: public
Return Type: void



Then, create subclasses Dog  

Cat that override the makeSound() method to make specific 

Method Name: makeSound
Access Modifier: public
Return Type: void

sounds like (e.g bark..bark), respectively.

Main Class:(ELC Class)

Create instances of Animal, Dog, and Cat.
Use polymorphism to call the makeSound method on each instance.
Demonstrate the overridden behavior.


Test Case 1:
---------------
 Calling makeSound on Animal instance

Input:
Create an instance of Animal.
Call the makeSound method.

Expected Output:
"Some generic animal sound"

Test Case 2: 
---------------
Calling makeSound on Dog instance

Input:
Create an instance of Dog.
Call the makeSound method.

Expected Output:
"Bark! Bark!"



Question-3
--------------

calculateFuelEfficiency

Vehicle Class:

Implement a Vehicle class with a method calculateFuelEfficiency that calculates fuel efficiency based on distance and fuel consumed. Overload this method to handle different units of distance (kilometers and miles).


// Parent class Vehicle

Instance variable:-

double totalDistance,private

double totalFuelConsumed,private


// Constructor parameterise


// Method to calculate fuel efficiency in kilometers per liter

Method Name:-

calculateFuelEfficiency()

Access Modifier:-

public

Return Type:-

double



// Method to calculate fuel efficiency with miles and gallons as input

Method Name:-

calculateFuelEfficiency()

Access Modifier:-

public

Return Type:-

double


// Subclass Car inheriting from Vehicle

// Constructor parameterise with super class 

// Override the calculateFuelEfficiency method to provide a specific implementation for Car

calculateFuelEfficiency()

Access Modifier:-

public

Return Type:-

double


// Assuming totalDistance and totalFuelConsumed are in kilometers and liters respectively

// Convert efficiency from km/l to miles/gallon

// 1 km/l = 2.35215 miles/gallon



Create a class Main which contains main method to test your code.

 Creating a Vehicle object
 Calculating fuel efficiency in km/l using the first method
 Calculating fuel efficiency in miles/gallon using the overloaded method

 Creating a Car object

 Calculating fuel efficiency in miles/gallon using the overridden method in Car class

Taste Case -1:
---------------
Sample Input: 
totalDistance = 500
totalFuelConsumed = 50
Expected Output:

Fuel Efficiency (km/l): 10.0
Fuel Efficiency (miles/gallon): 23.51743298568725
Car Fuel Efficiency (miles/gallon): 23.51743298568725

Taste Case-2 :
---------------
Sample Input: totalDistance = 500 
totalFuelConsumed = 0

Expected Output:

Error: Fuel consumed cannot be zero.
