Program: 1
-----------
Define an abstract class 'Shape' with following specifications
Methods:
1. Name: getArea
   ReturnType: double
   Modifier: abstract
2. Name: printDetails
    ReturnType: double
    Modifier: abstract
Define sub-classes of Shape as Rectangle, Circle and Triangle that overrides the methods of shape
Rectangle class
Fields:
	1. length - double
	2. breadth - double
Constructors:
	A parametrized constructor the accepts and initializes length and breadth.
Circle class
Fields:
	1. radius - double
Constructors:
	A parametrized constructor the accepts and initializes radius.
Triangle class
Fields:
	1. base - double
	2. height - double
Constructors:
	A parametrized constructor the accepts and initializes base and height.
All the sub-classes of Shape should override the methods of the shape.
getArea() should return the area of the respective shape.
printDetails() should print the shape details as below
	input:  Rectangle(30.3, 45.4)
	output:
		Type = Rectangle
		Length = 30.3
		Breadth = 45.4
		Area = 1375.62
	input: Circle(23.2)
	output:
		Type = Circle
		Radius = 23.2
		Area = 1690.0736
	input: Triangle(146.2, 40.0);
	output:
		Type = Triangle
		Base = 146.2
		Height = 40.0
		Area = 2924.0
Given a class Testing with main method to test your code.

We have a class named as Car and it is abstract class we need to implement abstract method in 
sub class named as Test
For abstract class Car 
Instance Variables:
brand : String default
model : String default
mileage : int default
top_speed : int default
yearOfManufacturing : int default
Methods:
No Argument Constructor
carBrand() : String : It return brand of the car by using brand variable so initialize brand variable and return it.

carModel() : String : It return model of the car by using model variable so initialize model variable and return it.

carMileage() : int : It return mileage of the car by using mileage variable so initialize mileage variable and return it 

carTopSpeed() : int : It return topspeed of the car by using top_speed variable so initialize top-speed variable and return it 

carYear() : int : It return year of manufacturing of the car by using yearOfManufacturing 

variable so initialize yearOfManufacturing variable and return it
display() : void : abstract : This is abstract method to implement in 

sub class
Create a sub class of Car called as Test
Methods:
@Override
display(): void : It print all the details of parent class
This class having main method to test the solutions of parent class

Nutrition in food can be broken down into proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Implement the following classes about food and nutrition to complete this challenge:

1. abstract class Food with the following properties:

double proteins
double fats
double carbs
double tastyScore
void getMacroNutrients [Abstract Method]

2. class Egg which extends class Food and has the following properties:

Constructor to initialize the attributes (proteins, fats, and carbs) in the same order.
int tastyScore = 7
String type = "non-vegetarian"
void getMacroNutrients => prints("An egg has [this.proteins] gms of protein, [this.fats] gms of fats and [this.carbs] gms of carbohydrates.")

3. class Bread which extends class Food and has the following properties:

Constructor to initialize the attributes (proteins, fats, and carbs) in the same order.
int tastyScore = 8
String type = "vegetarian"
void getMacroNutrients => prints(" A slice of bread has [this.proteins] gms of protein, [this.fats] gms of fats and [this.carbs] gms of carbohydrates.")
 

Create an ELC class Testing
The first line contains an integer, n, the number of food items.

Every food item takes input in the next 4 lines where the first line is the name of the food and the next three lines are method calls (getType, getTaste, and getMacros) 

Input :-
1
Bread
getType
getMacros
getTaste
Output :-

Bread is vegetarian
A slice of bread has 4.0 gms of protein, 1.1 gms of fats and 13.8 gms of carbohydrates.
Taste: 8
